# Build Instructions

To perform the build you need to have Java Development Kit installed and to run the following command:

$ ./gradlew buildDeb

Or alternatively if you have Gradle installed in your path

$ gradle buildDeb

The resulting debian package should appear on the following path:
[projectRoot]/pod-manager/build/distributions/rsa-podm-webapp-[version]_all.deb

Alternatively if you only need war archive it should appear on the following path:
[projectRoot]/pod-manager/podm-rest/build/libs/rsa-podm-[version]-rest.war
